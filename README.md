This code implements a simple GFM (Group Feedback Mechanism) Management System for students and teachers. Students can register or log in, then perform actions such as submitting doubt or help requests and updating personal information. Teachers can also register or log in, and they can handle student requests, update their information, display student attendance, and enter attendance percentages.
